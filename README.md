Kick XAUUSD is a low-slippage Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is specifically designed for trading Gold (XAUUSD) in the Forex market. This EA aims to optimize trades by minimizing slippage and implementing a unique stop-loss strategy.

## Features

- Low-slippage trading: The EA operates exclusively with brokers that offer low slippage, ensuring trades are executed as close to the intended price as possible.
- Unique stop-loss strategy: Kick XAUUSD implements a default stop loss of 5 pips for gold trades. This strategy significantly reduces potential losses during rapid market movements.
- Broker compatibility: It takes into account that most brokers do not accept a 2-pip stop loss, preventing any potential issues with trade execution.
- Trade optimization: Traders have the ability to optimize their trades by limiting slippage, providing greater control over their trading strategies.

## Technical Specifications

The Kick XAUUSD algorithm is implemented through the following essential trading functions:

1. **Initialization function (OnInit()):** This function checks if the broker allows a 2-pip stop loss. If not, it displays an error message and stops the initialization process.

2. **Tick function (OnTick()):** This function contains the main trading logic. It checks if the current market price is close to the intended price, based on the stop loss value. If the price is close, the EA executes the trade at the intended price and applies the stop loss strategy. If slippage is detected, the EA adjusts the trade execution and optimizes trades by limiting slippage.

3. **Deinitialization function (OnDeinit()):** This function performs necessary deinitialization tasks and prints the reason for deinitialization.
